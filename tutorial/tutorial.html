  <p><a href="#wtf">What's all this stuff between lines 1-15? Is my computer being hacked?!</a></p>
  <p><a href="#hack">Hey, I've seen this stuff before. Show me how to build an app!</a></p>
</section>

<section id="wtf">
  <h1>Nope, it's code.</h1>
  <p>That is HTML, the language that all pages on the Web are made of.</p>
  <p><a href="#about-html">Oh neat, tell me more.</a></p>
  <p><a href="#hack">Ok, let's get started coding then!</a></p>
</section>

<section id="about-html">
  <h1>HTML is cool.</h1>
  <p>If a Web page were an organism, HTML would be like its bones,
    providing structure.</p>
  <p>HTML is made up of <em>tags</em>, which often come in pairs. For
    example, line 1 is an <em>opening</em> HTML tag, while line 15 is
    a <em>closing</em> HTML tag. You can identify tags by the
    <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> at either end.</p>
  <p>A pair of tags and the space between them is sometimes called a <em>block</em> or <em>element</em> of HTML. The space between can contain text or more <em>nested</em> elements; when <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/3D_View" target="_blank">visualized</a>, this can look like a series of boxes stacked atop one another.</p>
  <p>For example, lines 2-10 comprise the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element,
    while lines 11-14 form the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. Both of
    these elements are nested in the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element.</p>

  <aside>
    <p>If you'd like to learn more about tags, try playing <a href="https://mousemeredith.makes.org/thimble/LTE2Mjc5Nzk3NzY=/tag-tag-revolution-activity" target="_blank">Tag Tag Revolution</a> with some friends.</p>
  </aside>

  <p><a href="#hack">Okay, let's start writing some code.</a></p>
</section>

<section id="hack" role="challenge" data-challenge-id="load">
  <h1>Let's start coding.</h1>
  <p>The first thing we'll do is add a <em>script</em> to this webpage.</p>
  <p>Scripts are like the brain, muscles, and central nervous system of a webpage: they allow a page to respond to user input, talk to the internet, and change itself in ways that can transform it from an inert page into a full-fledged application.</p>
  <p>To add our script, type the following at line 4:</p>

  <pre data-lang="htmlmixed">&lt;script src="{{{baseURL}}}weather-outfit.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

  <aside><p>Please do try to <em>type</em> the above code instead of copying and pasting it (copy-pasting just the URL is okay though). You'll learn better that way!</p></aside>

  <div class="challenge-incomplete">
    <p>Waiting for you to complete this challenge&hellip; <i class="fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin"></i></p>
  </div>
  <div class="challenge-complete">
    <h2>Hooray!</h2>
    <p>The page is now loading the script, which is injecting an app into it.</p>
    <p><a href="#style">Onwards!</a></p>
  </div>
</section>

<section id="style" role="challenge">
  <h1>Put some clothes on that webpage!</h1>
  <p>The webpage now has a somewhat broken app in it, which you'll be fixing. The first thing you'll want to do is add a <em>stylesheet</em> to the page so it doesn't look gross.</p>
  <p>Stylesheets are written using a language called CSS, and are like the skin or clothing of a webpage: a set of rules draped over HTML to make it look pretty (or, in some cases, grotesque).</p>
  <p>To add our stylesheet, type the following at line 3:</p>
  <pre data-lang="htmlmixed">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="{{{baseURL}}}weather-outfit.css"&gt;</pre>
  <div class="challenge-incomplete">
    <p>Waiting for you to add the stylesheet&hellip; <i class="fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin"></i></p>
  </div>
  <div class="challenge-complete">
    <h2>Yay!</h2>
    <p>The page is no longer naked and looks more presentable.</p>
    <aside>
      <p>Want to deep-dive? You can <a href="https://github.com/toolness/weather-outfit-fun/blob/gh-pages/weather-outfit.css" target="_blank">view the source</a> of the CSS file at line 3, and learn more about CSS at <a href="http://www.htmldog.com/guides/css/" target="_blank">HTML Dog</a>.</p>
    </aside>
    <p><a href="#cookbook">Okay, let's fix the rest of the app.</a></p>
  </div>
</section>

<section id="cookbook">
  <h1>Recipes and cookbooks</h1>
  <p>Try using the app now.</p>
  <p>While it's prettier, it's also still broken: after you either enter the name of a place or use geolocation, there's a red box at the top of the page mentioning something about <code>ReferenceError: getForecastOutfit is not defined</code>.</p>
  <p>Computers run JavaScript much the same way cooks follow recipes. Just as building a meal requires cooking and combining different recipes from cookbooks, so too does JavaScript often follow its own kind of recipes, called <em>functions</em>, to accomplish simple tasks.</p>
  <p>In this case, the JavaScript brought into the page in line 4 is trying to call a function called <code>getForecastOutfit</code>, but it's not in any of the page's "cookbooks", so to speak.</p>
  <p>It's time to <a href="#js">write that recipe</a>.</p>
</section>

<section id="js" role="challenge">
  <h1>Adding our own recipe</h1>
  <p>The opening <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag at line 5 tells the browser to start processing the text until the closing <code>&lt;/script&gt;</code> tag at line 8 as JavaScript code. This is where we'll define our <code>getForecastOutfit</code> function.</p>
  <p>Type the following at line 6:</p>
  <pre data-lang="javascript">function getForecastOutfit(forecast) {
  return "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Eskimo_woman_by_Lomen_Brothers%2C_ca._1915.jpg/444px-Eskimo_woman_by_Lomen_Brothers%2C_ca._1915.jpg";
}</pre>
  <div class="challenge-incomplete">
    <p>Waiting for you to define the function&hellip; <i class="fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-spin"></i></p>
  </div>
  <div class="challenge-complete">
    <p>Awesome. Now that the function is defined, the app can find it and use it to show the user an outfit to wear.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<section id="title" role="challenge">
  <h1>Personalize the page title.</h1>
  <p>See the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element at line 9? That tells
    your browser what the name of your page is, so it can display it
    in the window (or tab) title bar.</p>
  <p>The <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element at line 12 is part of the page
    body and shows the app's title on the page itself.</p>
  <p>Try changing the text of both elements to something a bit more
    unique. For instance, if your name is Pat, you could change the
    text to <em>Pat's Outfit Of The Day</em>.</p>
